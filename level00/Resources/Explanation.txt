After watching the Project Video, I noticed that he had the word "find" in uppercases, so I did look up the command find.

After looking it up in the internet we understood how to use it and the command line would be something like this.

level00@SnowCrash:~$ find / -user flag00

We get too much Errors so we dump them into /dev/null leaving us with only 2 paths related to flag00

level00@SnowCrash:~$ find / -user flag00 2>/dev/null
/usr/sbin/john
/rofs/usr/sbin/john

Now we check this path.

level00@SnowCrash:~$ cat /usr/sbin/john
cdiiddwpgswtgt

We get what it looks like to be an encryption,

Then we just go to dcode.fr, we paste the encryption there to find out that its a caesar encryption based on rot15.

Then we use the same site to decrypt it finding: nottoohardhere

So now we log into flag00 with this password

level00@SnowCrash:~$ su flag00
Password: nottoohardhere
Don't forget to launch getflag !

Then we just launch a simple get flag
flag00@SnowCrash:~$ getflag
Check flag.Here is your token : x24ti5gi3x0ol2eh4esiuxias
